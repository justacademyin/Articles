JavaScript is a popular high-level, interpreted programming language used to create interactive and dynamic effects on web pages. It is commonly used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs on the user's web browser rather than on a remote server. This allows for faster processing and increased interactivity for the user. JavaScript can be used to validate user inputs, manipulate web page content, and create animations and visual effects. It is also widely used in developing web and mobile applications. Its versatility and compatibility with other web technologies make it a valuable tool for web developers.
