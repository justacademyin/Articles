Django is a Python-based web framework that provides a full-stack solution for building web applications. React, on the other hand, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Angular is an open-source front-end web development framework that is maintained by Google. Django is ideal for creating complex and scalable back-end systems, while React and Angular are best for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React and Angular are built for single-page applications, while Django is better for creating traditional server-side rendered websites. Ultimately, the choice between these technologies depends on the specific needs and goals of the project.

1) Django is a back-end web development framework written in Python. It's used for building complex and scalable web applications. React and Angular are front-end JavaScript frameworks.

2) Django offers a full-featured Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, whereas React and Angular have a component-based architecture that involves reusable and encapsulated UI components.

3) React focuses on creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while Angular provides a comprehensive solution for both front-end and back-end development. Django is more suitable for back-end development, while it can also be used for front-end with the help of its template system.

4) Django uses a battery-included approach, providing developers with a wide range of built-in features. React is more lightweight and flexible, allowing developers to choose the specific libraries and tools they need for their project. Angular also has a comprehensive collection of built-in features and tools.

5) In terms of job opportunities and market demand, all three technologies have a strong presence in the industry. However, React and Angular are more popular and widely used compared to Django, especially in front-end development roles. Having a strong understanding of all three can greatly enhance a student's career prospects in the tech industry.
