Flutter is a cross-platform development framework that allows Angular developers to build beautiful, high-performance mobile applications for both Android and iOS devices using their existing knowledge of Angular. With its fast development cycle, rich set of widgets, and support for hot reloading, Flutter enables developers to quickly create and experiment with stunning user interfaces and bring their apps to life in record time. Its reactive and flexible architecture, along with its ability to reuse code across platforms, makes it a powerful tool for Angular developers looking to extend their reach to mobile users.
