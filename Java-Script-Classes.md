Java Script Classes provide a way to create reusable objects with properties and methods. This helps in organizing and structuring code in a more efficient manner. Classes can also have inheritance, where one class can inherit properties and methods from another class. This helps in promoting code reusability and maintaining a clear and organized code structure. Classes in Java Script also support the concept of constructors, which are used to initialize object properties when creating new instances of the class. Overall, Java Script Classes aid in creating more organized and manageable code, promoting efficient development and maintenance.

1) Classes in JavaScript are a way to create reusable, organized code by defining a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and methods.
2) They provide a way to easily create multiple objects with the same structure and behavior, reducing code repetition and increasing efficiency.
3) Classes are defined using the "class" keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces containing the properties and methods.
4) Constructor functions are used within classes to initialize objects with specific values for their properties.
5) Inheritance can be implemented in classes through the use of "extends" and "super" keywords, allowing for the creation of subclasses with additional or modified features.
