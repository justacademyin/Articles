Javascript is a dynamic programming language commonly used to create interactive and dynamic elements on web pages. It runs on the client side, meaning that it is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a web server. Its main purpose is to enhance the user experience by allowing for the manipulation of HTML elements, creating animations, and handling user input. It is widely used in web development and has become an essential tool for creating modern and engaging websites.
