AngularJS is typically classified as a frontend technology as it is primarily used to develop single-page web applications, running in the user's browser. However, it does have some backend capabilities as it can communicate with servers, handle authentication and data manipulation. In general, AngularJS is a client-side technology, allowing developers to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. It works in conjunction with backend technologies like Node.js, Java, or .NET to build a complete application.
