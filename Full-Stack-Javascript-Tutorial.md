1) Introduction to Full Stack JavaScript:
- Full stack JavaScript refers to the practice of using JavaScript for both client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) development. 
- It allows developers to use a single language and set of tools to build a complete web application, from the user interface to the server hosting the application.

2) Understanding Front-end Development:
- The front-end or client-side of a web application is responsible for everything the user sees and interacts with, such as the layout, design, and functionality of the website. 
- This includes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

3) Exploring Back-end Development:
- The back-end or server-side of a web application is responsible for handling data and requests from the front-end. 
- It involves using technologies like Node.js, Express, and databases (such as MongoDB) to develop server-side logic and APIs.

4) Integration and Communication:
- In full stack JavaScript development, the front-end and back-end must be able to communicate and work together seamlessly. 
- This is achieved through the use of technologies like AJAX, which allows for asynchronous communication between the client and server.

5) Building a Complete Web Application:
- Through a full stack JavaScript tutorial, students will learn how to bring together all the components of a web application - front-end, back-end, and communication - to build a functional and polished website. 
- They will also gain an understanding of the overall development process and best practices, such as version control and debugging, to create a robust and efficient application.
