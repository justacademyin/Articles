Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google. It allows developers to build high-quality, native mobile applications for both Android and iOS using a single codebase. To install Flutter, one needs to first download the Flutter SDK and set it up on their local machine. This includes installing and configuring various dependencies like Android Studio, Xcode, and the Flutter plugin. After installation, developers can use the command line interface or an integrated development environment to create, run, and test their Flutter applications.

2) Set up the Development Environment: After installing the Flutter SDK, developers need to set up their development environment by configuring the Flutter path and adding it to their system's PATH variable.

3) Choose an IDE: Flutter can be used with various IDEs, including Android Studio, IntelliJ Idea, and Visual Studio Code. Developers can choose the one that best suits their preferences and needs.

4) Install and Configure Android Emulator: To run and test Flutter apps on an Android device, developers need to have an Android emulator installed on their system. They can either use the Android Studio emulator or set up a custom one.

5) Run a Sample App: Once all the necessary tools and configurations are set up, developers can test their installation by running a sample app provided by Flutter. This will ensure that everything is working correctly and they are ready to start developing their own apps.
