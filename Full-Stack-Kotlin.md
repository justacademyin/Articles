Full stack Kotlin refers to the use of the Kotlin programming language for both front-end and back-end development. Kotlin is a versatile and modern language that can be used for web development, mobile development, and server-side development. Its concise syntax and compatibility with various programming platforms make it an ideal choice for creating end-to-end solutions. With full stack Kotlin, developers can build robust, scalable, and efficient applications faster and with fewer lines of code. Additionally, features like null safety, coroutines, and functional programming make Kotlin an efficient and powerful choice for full stack development.
