MERN stack is a popular JavaScript stack used for building full-stack web applications. It consists of four main technologies - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, which work together to provide a robust and efficient development environment. MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage data, Express.js is the web application framework, React.js is used for front-end development, and Node.js is the back-end JavaScript runtime environment. This stack allows developers to use a single language, JavaScript, for the entire development process, making it easier to learn and use. It also provides an efficient and scalable solution for building modern web applications.

1) Basics of Web Development: The first step in learning the MERN stack is to have a basic understanding of web development. This includes knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as these are the languages used to build websites and web applications.

2) Understanding React: React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is an essential part of the MERN stack as it allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive UIs. Students will learn the fundamentals of React and how to use it to build modern web applications.

3) Working with Node.js: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows for the development of server-side applications. In this training program, students will learn how to use Node.js to handle server-side logic and build APIs for their MERN stack projects.

4) Database Management with MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is used in the MERN stack for storing and managing data. Students will learn how to set up and use MongoDB to store data for their applications.

5) Building a Full-Stack Application: The ultimate goal of learning the MERN stack is to be able to build a full-stack web application. In this training program, students will learn how to integrate all the components of the MERN stack to develop a fully functional web application from scratch. This will include building the frontend with React, setting up the backend with Node.js, and connecting to the MongoDB database.
