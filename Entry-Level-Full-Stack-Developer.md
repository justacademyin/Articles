An entry level full stack developer is a software professional who possesses both front-end and back-end development skills, allowing them to build complete web applications from beginning to end. They may have knowledge of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side languages like Java, Python, or PHP. They are proficient in working with databases, server-side technologies, and UI/UX design. They may also have experience in version control systems and agile methodologies, but may still be in the early stages of their career and gaining practical experience through hands-on projects and learning from experienced developers.
