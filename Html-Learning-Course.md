HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of the web, used to create and structure the content of a website. HTML learning courses teach students how to write and design web pages using HTML tags, attributes, and elements. They also cover important concepts such as website structure, accessibility, and responsive design. Through hands-on projects and exercises, students gain a solid understanding of HTML and learn how to create professional-looking websites. With the ever-growing demand for digital presence, learning HTML is a valuable skill that can open up many opportunities in the field of web development.
