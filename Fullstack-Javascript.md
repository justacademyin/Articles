Fullstack JavaScript refers to the use of JavaScript for both front-end and back-end web development. It involves using JavaScript not only for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces on the client-side, but also for server-side programming and database management. This means that a single language (JavaScript) is used for all aspects of web development, providing a more streamlined and efficient process. Fullstack JavaScript developers have a comprehensive understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing them to build fully functional and robust web applications.
