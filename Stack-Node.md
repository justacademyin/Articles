A stack node is an element or item in a stack data structure that holds a value and a reference to the next node in the stack, forming a linked list structure. It is the building block of a stack, representing a piece of data that can be added or removed from the stack. Each node in a stack has a last-in-first-out (LIFO) relationship, meaning that the most recently added node will be the first one removed. The top node in a stack is the one currently being accessed and any new nodes are added to the top of the stack.

1) A stack node is a data structure used in programming to store and organize data in a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) manner. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. 
2) Stack nodes are typically used to implement a stack, which is a basic data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements only from one end.
3) Each stack node contains the data that needs to be stored and a pointer to the next node in the stack.
4) When a new element is added to the stack, it becomes the top element and any future elements added will be pushed on top of it.
5) Similarly, when an element is removed, the top element is popped off the stack and the next element becomes the new top. This process continues until the stack is empty.
