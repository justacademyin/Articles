1) Basic syntax and data types: The first step in learning Javascript is understanding its basic syntax and different data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans. This forms the foundation of writing any code in Javascript. 

2) Variables and functions: Variables are used to store and manipulate data, while functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Learning how to declare variables and write functions is essential for building more complex programs in Javascript. 

3) DOM manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is the web standard for representing HTML elements. In simple terms, it allows Javascript to access and manipulate the content and styling of a webpage. Learning how to use DOM manipulation is crucial in creating dynamic and interactive web pages. 

4) Conditional statements and loops: Conditional statements allow code to execute only if a certain condition is met, while loops help repeat a block of code until a specific condition is satisfied. These are important concepts in programming and essential for building more complex logic in Javascript. 

5) Debugging and troubleshooting: Like any other programming language, Javascript can have errors and bugs in the code. Learning how to debug and troubleshoot code is an important skill for any programmer. It involves identifying and fixing errors in the code to ensure it runs smoothly. Overall, this is a crucial step in becoming proficient in Javascript coding.
