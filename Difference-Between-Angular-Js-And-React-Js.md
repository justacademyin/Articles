Angular JS and React JS are both popular front-end JavaScript frameworks used for building user interfaces. The main difference between them lies in their approach to web development. Angular JS is a comprehensive framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and offers a feature-rich development experience with a steep learning curve. On the other hand, React JS is a lightweight library that follows the Virtual DOM concept and focuses on building reusable and scalable components. It has a shallow learning curve and is more suitable for building single-page web applications.

1) Angular JS is a JavaScript-based front-end development framework, while React JS is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.

2) Angular JS uses a two-way data binding approach to automatically synchronize data between the model and the view, while React JS uses a one-way data flow approach which makes it more predictable and easier to debug.

3) Angular JS has a steeper learning curve compared to React JS, as it requires knowledge of concepts like modules, controllers, and directives. React JS, on the other hand, is relatively simpler to grasp for beginners.

4) Angular JS is a complete framework that provides out-of-the-box features for building complex web applications, whereas React JS is primarily focused on the view layer and needs additional libraries and tools for building a complete application.

5) Angular JS is maintained and developed by Google, while React JS was created by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers. Both have a large and active community support, providing regular updates, tutorials, and resources for developers.
