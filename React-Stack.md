React Stack refers to the order in which React components are rendered and nested within each other. This stack follows a last-in-first-out approach, meaning the most recently added component will be rendered first while the first component added will be rendered last. This allows for efficient management of components and their state, allowing for a highly effective and scalable user interface development.
