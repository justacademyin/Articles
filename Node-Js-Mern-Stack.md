Node.js MERN stack is a full-stack open-source web development framework that combines four powerful technologies: Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB. Node.js allows for server-side JavaScript execution and provides a high-performance non-blocking I/O framework, while Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework that helps with routing and handling HTTP requests. React is a client-side JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format, making it easy to work with in the Node.js environment. This combination of technologies enables developers to build fast, scalable, and modern web applications with a consistent language and a unified codebase.
