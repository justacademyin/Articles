1) Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework, developed by Google, which uses the programming language Dart to build high-quality, native interfaces for iOS and Android platforms.

2) Dart is an object-oriented, client-optimized programming language that helps in developing fast, responsive, and secure applications. With its "just in time" (JIT) compilation, Dart allows for efficient execution of code, making Flutter apps run smoothly.

3) One of the key advantages of using Flutter is its hot reload feature, which enables developers to see changes in the code instantly without having to rebuild and recompile the entire application. This results in a faster and more efficient development process.

4) Flutter offers a rich set of customizable widgets, which makes it easier for developers to create beautiful and consistent user interfaces across different platforms. These widgets also allow for faster development and reduced codebase, saving time and effort for developers.

5) As Flutter uses a single codebase for both iOS and Android, it significantly reduces the development time and resources required, making it a cost-effective option for building cross-platform mobile applications. This makes it a valuable skill for students to learn, making them highly in-demand in the job market.
