1) Introduction to React: The full stack React tutorial will begin with an overview of what React is and why it has become one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces. Students will learn about its core concepts, such as components, JSX, and virtual DOM, and how to use them to create dynamic user interfaces.

2) Front-end Development with React: The training program will cover front-end development with React, including setting up a development environment, creating components, handling events, and managing state. Students will also learn about popular libraries and tools used with React, such as Redux and React Router.

3) Back-end Development with React: In the full stack React tutorial, students will also learn how to use React in conjunction with a back-end technology, such as Node.js or Express, to create a complete full stack application. They will learn about server-side rendering, RESTful APIs, and database integration.

4) Data Management with React: Understanding how to manage data is crucial for building robust web applications. The training program will cover data management in React, including using state and props to pass data between components, managing application state with Redux, and making API calls to fetch and update data.

5) Real-World Project: The full stack React tutorial will conclude with a hands-on project, where students will apply everything they have learned to create a full stack application from scratch. This project will provide the opportunity for students to practice their skills and showcase their understanding of React and its ecosystem.
