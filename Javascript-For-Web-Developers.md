Javascript is a powerful scripting language that allows web developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It is primarily used for front-end development to add functionality such as form validation, user input, and animations. With its ability to work seamlessly with HTML and CSS, Javascript plays a crucial role in creating responsive and user-friendly websites. It also has a wide range of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and jQuery, making it a versatile tool for creating dynamic web applications. As a developer, having a strong understanding of Javascript can greatly enhance your ability to create visually appealing and functional websites.
