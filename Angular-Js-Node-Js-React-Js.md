AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that is used to build dynamic web applications. It follows the Model-View-Controller architecture and uses HTML as its template language. It provides features such as data binding, dependency injection, and routing, making it easier to develop client-side applications. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server instead of the browser, making it possible to develop server-side applications using JavaScript. React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to maintain large and complex applications. It uses a virtual DOM, which makes it fast and efficient, and also supports server-side rendering for better performance. Combining these technologies can result in high-performing, scalable, and maintainable applications.

1) Angular JS: Angular JS is an open-source front-end JavaScript framework developed by Google. It allows developers to build dynamic and interactive web applications by using data binding, modular components, and dependency injection. It is widely used for creating single page applications (SPAs) and has a strong community support.

2) Node JS: Node JS is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable, high-performing web applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it lightweight and efficient for handling real-time applications. It also has a large package ecosystem, making it easy to integrate with other technologies.

3) React JS: React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was created by Facebook and is widely used for building single page applications, mobile applications, and complex UIs. React uses a virtual DOM to update the UI efficiently, making it fast and lightweight. It also allows for reusable components, making it easier for developers to maintain and update their code.
